An Adversarial Example Attack Method Based on Predicted Bounding Box Adaptive Deformation in Optical Remote Sensing Images 
==

This code performs the experiments presented in our paper, An Adversarial Example Attack Method Based on Predicted Bounding Box Adaptive Deformation in Optical Remote Sensing Images. The code has been refactored from the version used to perform the experiments in the paper.

Our code uses Pytorch (pytorch >= 1.10.1, torchvision >= 0.11.2) with CUDA 11.3 and Python 3.8. 

Our code is implemented based on the previous work [AllYouNeed](https://github.com/diyage/AllYouNeed)
